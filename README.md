## Overview

This project is a Gomoku (Five in a Row) game that allows players to play against a computer. The game is created using Python and the `pygame` library for graphical interface and interaction. In Gomoku, the player and the AI take turns to place their respective pieces (X and O) on a grid, aiming to line up five pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Instructions to Run the Code

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install the `pygame` library by running the following command:
    ```
    pip install pygame
    ```
3. After the installation is complete, navigate to the project folder and run the `main.py` script to start the game:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
